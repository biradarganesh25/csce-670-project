Curricular Practical Training
F-1 international students interested in participating in an internship or co-op are highly encouraged to attend a CPT workshop. However, due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are setting up webinars for anyone who didn't participate in an in-person CPT workshop.
Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is off-campus work authorization for employment (whether it is paid or unpaid), such as an internship or co-op, for F-1 international students to receive further training. Come and learn how to obtain CPT authorization from ISS and what you will need to do to remain in status while you are authorized for CPT. This workshop/webinar will discuss the requirements, how to request authorization, and other information related to CPT.
CPT Workshops and Webinars for Fall 2022
Listed below are several opportunities for attending the CPT (Curricular Practical Training) workshops and webinars. There first is an in person CPT workshop. This CPT workshop will include a full CPT presentation followed by Q&A. The second will be a webinar with the same presentation and Q&A online. We will also provide several general employment webinars that will include a brief presentation on general employment followed by Q&A. These general employment webinars will have two breakout room. One for J-1 students and another for F-1 students.
