Optional Practical Training
F-1 students interested in having practical work experience in the U.S. after completing their academic program are encouraged to attend an OPT workshop or webinar.
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is temporary employment available to F-1 students. The employment must be related to the student's field of study and commensurate with the student's education level. F-1 students may be eligible for up to 12 months of OPT per degree level. Attend the OPT workshop or webinar to learn more about how to request this F-1 work authorization and how it can be utilized after graduation.
