Travel UpdatesTravel Restrictions and National Interest Exceptions (NIE)
The U.S. government has placed COVID-19 travel restrictions for the following countries: India, China, Iran, Brazil, South Africa, Schengen Area, United Kingdom, and Ireland. This means if you are physically located in one of these countries, you will not be able to directly enter the U.S. unless you first visit a country that is not under this travel restriction for a period of at least 14 days.
The U.S. government has stated that students who have been physically present in those impacted countries are able to qualify for a National Interest Exception only if their I-20 program start date is August 1, 2021 or later. This means that it may not be possible for you to enter the U.S. to begin studies for Summer 2021 term. Students with J-1 visas may have to apply for the National Interest Exception at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
New Travel Restrictions from India to the United States
April 30, 2021, President Biden's administration has announced its intentions to restrict travel from India on Tuesday, May 4, 2021.  The travel restriction is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 4, 2021.
"Suspension and Limitation on Entry.  The entry into the United States, as nonimmigrants, of noncitizens who were physically present within the Republic of India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation."

Extension of Eligibility for the National Interest Exceptions (NIE)
April 30, 2021, the Department of State extended the qualification to the NIE for F-1 students from India.
"Students and certain academics covered by exchange visitor programs. Students subject to these geographic COVID proclamations due to their presence in India, China, Iran, Brazil, or South Africa, may qualify for a National Interest Exception only if their academic program begins August 1, 2021 or later. Students with valid F-1 and M-1 visas intending to begin or continue an academic program commencing August 1, 2021 or later do not need to contact an embassy or consulate to seek an individual National Interest Exception to travel. They may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before the start of their academic studies. Students seeking to apply for new F-1 or M-1 visas should check the status of visa services at the nearest embassy or consulate; those applicants who are found to be otherwise qualified for an F-1 or M-1 visa will automatically be considered for a national interest exception to travel."
April 26, 2021, the Department of State stated that F-1 students located in Iran, Brazil, South Africa, Schengen Area, United Kingdom and Ireland are eligible for travel exceptions from the Presidential Proclamations.  The news release stated "Students with valid F-1 and M-1 visas intending to begin or continue an academic program commencing August 1, 2021 or later do not need to contact an embassy or consulate to seek an individual NIE to travel.  They may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before the start of their academic studies.  Students seeking to apply for new F-1 or M-1 visas should check the status of visa services at the nearest embassy or consulate; those applicants who are found to be otherwise qualified for an F-1 or M-1 visa will automatically be considered for an NIE to travel."

ArchivesTravel Updates: November 8, 2021
Effective November 8th, 2021, the previous travel ban restrictions were lifted and nonimmigrants traveling to the United States by air are now required to show they are fully vaccinated or reflect why they are exempt.  What does this mean?
You must be fully vaccinated to travel to the United States by plane if you are a non-U.S. citizen, non-U.S. immigrant (not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or traveling to the United States on an immigrant visa). Only limited exceptions apply.
You are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 when you travel to the United States by air. The timing of this test depends on your vaccination status and age.
Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required in indoor areas of public transportation (including airplanes) traveling into, within, or out of the United States and indoors in U.S. transportation hubs (including airports).
If you are a non-U.S. citizen non-U.S. immigrant and not fully vaccinated, you should carefully review the limited exceptions to the requirement to show proof of vaccination to see if any apply to you. If you are unvaccinated and do not meet any of the exceptions, you will not be permitted entry to the U.S. Even if you do qualify for one of the available exceptions, additional requirements may apply to you based on the exception category and length of time you plan to remain in the U.S.
For additional information about the vaccination requirement and exceptions, refer to the following links.
