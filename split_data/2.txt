CAPS Let's Talk
ISSS has partnered with CAPS (TAMU Counseling and Psychological Services) to provide a program called Let’s Talk. This program provides international students a space to discuss concerns related to transitioning to a new environment and culture, academic concerns and other stressors such as family, relationships, financial stress and immigration concerns, religious concerns, etc, as these concerns impact student mental health and academic achievement.
The Let’s Talk program is an outreach initiative that meets and engages students in conversation with a CAPS counselor in an environment that feels safe and empowering to them. The Let’s Talk program is not a substitute for psychotherapy or formal counseling and does not constitute mental health treatment. If a student visits the Let’s Talk Program and they require additional support, such as crisis services or counseling, or if they would benefit from additional CAPS services, the student will be referred to CAPS for further assessment, support, and linkage to the appropriate services.
The Let’s Talk program is offered on alternating Fridays during the Fall and Spring semesters.
